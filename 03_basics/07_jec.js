// Javascript Execution  Context (JEC)

// In browser the value of this is , " Window object".

// Firstly program files has to "run" in  "Global EC" , which is allocated in "this".

// Functional EC, Eval EC

// firstly the files are sended to Memory "creation phase" ,where a space is allocated for the variables or anything in the program.

// Secondly, then the are executed in the "Execution Phase".



// Phase 1 : GEC => this
// Phase 2 : Memory Creation :
//         val1 = undefined
//         val2 = undefined

//         addNum = defintion(function)
//         result1 = undefined
//         result2 = undefined
// Phase 3 : Execution Phase :
//           Again 1. Memory Creation
//           2. Execution Phase 

// Then the result is reflected to the "GEC".
